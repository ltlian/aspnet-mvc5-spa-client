# ASP.NET MVC5 with single-page frontend application

This project demonstrates how one could migrate a legacy .NET framework MVC application to use a cookie-authenticated single-page web application as its frontend.

The ASP.NET 4.8 project can be found at <https://github.com/ltlian/aspnet-mvc5-spa>

For now, see the commit log for the necessary changes.
